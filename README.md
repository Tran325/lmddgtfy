# Sandwich Bot

## Overview

A sandwich bot on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) is a trading bot designed to exploit price fluctuations by placing front-running and back-running transactions around a target trade. 
It works by detecting pending transactions in the mempool, inserting buy orders before the target (front-running), and selling immediately after (back-running) to profit from the price impact. 
The BSC's lower fees and high transaction volume make it a popular chain for sandwich attacks. However, such bots operate in a legal gray area and may face scrutiny from regulators and exchanges.

## About
This is a high-frequency MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) sandwich bot operating on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The bot exploits price movements by front-running and back-running victim transactions, profiting from slippage and price impact.

## Key Features
- `PGA (Price Gas Auction)`: Competes with other bots by optimizing gas bids to ensure transaction priority.
- `ARC (Active Rug Combat)`: Detects and cancels transactions if a "rug pull" or malicious attack is detected before block finalization.
- `Next-Block Simulation`: Uses Geth API calls to simulate the next block and identify profitable sandwich opportunities.
- `Binary Search for Parameters`: Dynamically adjusts sandwich parameters (gas, slippage, profit thresholds) for optimal execution.
- `Fast Mempool Access (bloXroute)`: Ensures low-latency transaction monitoring and submission. 


## Risk
- Other Bots: Many sandwich bots operate on BSC, leading to intense PGA battles‚Äîhigher gas means higher priority but lower profit margins.
- Rug Pulls & Salmonella Attacks: Malicious tokens can drain funds; ARC helps mitigate losses by aborting bad trades.
- Non-Atomic Execution: Unlike Arbitrage (ARB) bots, sandwich trades are not atomic, requiring careful monitoring.

## Generalized MEV Bot ‚Äì Conceptual Overview
Let the actual sequence of transactions in the next block be denoted by:

```
T = {t‚ÇÄ, t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Çô}
```

However, since the true contents of the next block are unknowable in advance, we rely on our *best* mempool view, which gives us an estimated block:

```
T' = {t‚Ä≤‚ÇÄ, t‚Ä≤‚ÇÅ, t‚Ä≤‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Ä≤‚Çò}

```

A generalized MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bot** aims to insert a set of its own transactions:

```

X = {x‚ÇÄ, x‚ÇÅ, ..., x‚Çñ}

```

The goal is to construct a modified transaction sequence (i.e., a candidate block):

```
B = {t‚Ä≤‚ÇÄ, x‚ÇÄ, x‚ÇÅ, t‚Ä≤‚ÇÅ, t‚Ä≤‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÇ, ...}
```
We aim for `B` to be as close to `T` as possible. This is achieved using a good distributed nodes infrastructure like bloxroute or something of your own.
On BSC, some miners cheat and have lower delta between `B` and `T`, centralization is unfair on the chain. This was the case 4-5 years ago, I am not sure how much has the community changed since then.

The set of all possible such blocks `B` is effectively infinite due to the combinatorial explosion of insert positions
and transaction variations. Therefore, brute-force search over all possible blocks is intractable.

You can then run the following algorithm:
```

1. Check initial balance
2. For each candidate block b ‚àà B:
   While b is not yet mined:
    a. Simulate execution of b
    b. Check resulting balance
    c. If balance increased:
   Add b to list of profitable blocks
3. From the profitable blocks, execute the one with the highest gain

```

Due to the intractability of |B|, generalized MEV bots use heuristics to narrow down the search space. Common tactics include:

- **Sandwiching**: Placing a buy and sell order around a victim's trade.
- **Copy-trading bots**: Replicating profitable trades from observed mempool activity.
- **Arbitrage bots**: Exploiting price differences across DEXs or pools.
- **Sniping bots**: Front-running token launches or NFTs.

These heuristics enable MEV bots to act efficiently under latency and compute constraints.
You also need a reliable mempool view, this would require setting up infra costing thousands of dollars. Good investment.
